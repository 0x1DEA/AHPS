You skate.
You turn left.
You look out on the horizon.
You wonder why your partner left you.
You check your phone for new messages.
You start slowing down, but you kick again and now you're moving at responsible speeds!
You call a friend to see how they are doing.
The sun is setting. It looks nice.
You aren't here with anyone in particular, but you feel a gentle kinship with your fellow Professional Skateboarders. All is well.
You see a friend from middle school. I hope they're doing okay.
Schools out. You still have work to get done but for now you just skate.
You're used to rock music playing in the background but the gentle wind feels nice enough.
You fall. But it's okay because you get up afterwards.
I really like skating with you.
My son's been getting into making music. It's not really my style but I'm proud of him. I'm glad he's happy with his friends.
Man, this is like OSU but for... Never mind.
