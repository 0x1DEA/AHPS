A hawk flies above you. Do you name it?
There is a pipe. Do you grind on it?
You see the one any only Brian David Gilbert sitting on a bench? Do you say hi?
There is a ramp. You do go up then down it?
You are kinda bored just skating. Do you do an ollie?
Do you- Oh, dude hey there's an ice cream truck coming around. You wanna grab a cone?
Do you tweet something regrettable to Twitter?
There is a guy selling sugar. Do you buy some?
